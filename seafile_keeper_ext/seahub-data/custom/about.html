Support your team with the Keeper collaboration functionalities.\u000AThe Keeper Service is free of charge for all Max Planck employees. If you are from an external organization and collaborate with the Max Planck Society you are also invited to exploit the Keeper Service for all Max Planck related projects. Please contact the [Keeper support team](mailto:keeper@mpdl.mpg.de \u0022email to the Keeper support team\u0022).\u000A\u000A**Work local, store centralized. You retain the control of your data.**\u000A\u000AWith storing your data in Keeper you can be sure to fulfil the regulations of the Max Planck Society as well as the German Research Foundation to ensure ‘[good scientific practice](https://www.mpg.de/229457/Regeln_guter_wiss_Praxis__Volltext\u002DDokument_.pdf \u0022Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis\u0022)’. You can share and sync your active research projects with Keeper, knowing that your data is securely stored and backed up. Or you deposit your data to the Keeper Service after your project ends for long term compliant archiving.\u000A\u000A**When your project ends \u002D Keeper takes care of your data beyond**\u000A\u000AThe Keeper Service takes care of your data even after your project has ended and ensures a long term compliant storage. The [Max Planck Digital Library](https://www.mpdl.mpg.de \u0022Max Planck Digital Library\u0022) and the [Max Planck Computing and Data Facility](http://www.mpcdf.mpg.de/ \u0022Max Planck Computing and Data Facility\u0022) closely work together to guarantee the best storage and archiving strategies for your data.\u000A\u000A**Cared Data Certificate \u002D you do the right thing**\u000A\u000A**Keeper Cares:** With storing your data in Keeper you can be sure to fulfil the archiving regulations of the Max Planck Society and the German Research Organization to ensure good scientific practice. Additionally you can meet the requirements of leading publishers like nature or Springer.\u000AThe Keeper Service takes care of your data even after project ending and therefore ensures long term compliant archiving.\u000AWith storing your data in Keeper and agreeing to the Cared Data Commitment, you gain the Cared Data Certificate for your project. It can act as a proof of long term compliant archiving on your institutional homepage or poster and presentations.\u000A\u000A**Get an overview of all research projects within your Institute**\u000A\u000AAll research projects, stored in the Keeper service are listed in the project catalog, which is only accessible within the Max Planck Society. All metadata a user enters for his libraries (archive\u002Dmetadata.md file) are presented in the project catalog, together with the contact email of the library owner.\u000A\u000A**Client side encryption of your research data**\u000A\u000AAll libraries can be encrypted by the user. Before encrypting your data please be aware that:\u000A\u002D The Keeper administrators cannot recover your data when you lose your encryption key\u000A\u002D You cannot sign up for long term archiving according to good scientific practice (get the Cared Data Certificate)\u000A\u002D Once a library is encrypted you cannot remove the encryption.
